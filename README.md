# Website for the EuroTUG meeting

This site is created with the `jekyll` site generator.

## Building the site locally

For local testing, we have used `rbenv` to manage `ruby` versions. The particular `ruby` version is stored in `.ruby-version`.

To build and preview the site locally, follow [these instructions by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#building-your-site-locally).
