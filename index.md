# EuroTUG 2022 in Munich

The 2022 EuroTUG meeting will take place in Munich, Germany, under the auspices of

- [dtec.bw](www.dtecbw.de), in particular its project [hpc.bw: competence platform for software efficiency and supercomputing](https://dtecbw.de/home/forschung/hsu/projekt-hpcbw/projekt-hpcbw).

It will be jointly organized by

- [Dr. Matthias Mayr](mayrmt.github.io) (University of the Bundeswehr Munich)
- [Dr. Alexander Heinlein](searhein.github.io) (TU Delft).

## What is the EuroTUG meeting series?

The _European Trilinos User Group (EuroTUG)_ meeting series offers a platform for Europe-based users and developers
of the [Trilinos Project](https://trilinos.github.io) to

- learn about recent developments in Trilinos,
- report on their use cases and experiences with Trilinos,
- interact with the Trilinos leadership and core developers, and
- form a European network of Trilinos users and developers.

While the annual Trilinos User Group meeting hosted by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in Albuquerque, NM,
serves as the main community event for Trilinos users,
the EuroTUG facilitates easy access to the Trilinos community and reduced travel burdens for Europe-based researchers and application engineers
who are interested in the Trilinos project.

## Target Audience

The EuroTUG targets all Europe-based Trilinos users and developers, but is of course open for participants independent of their nationality or country of their affiliation.
The EuroTUG aims to offer a forum for all levels of proficiency and experience in developing or using Trilinos. In particular, the EuroTUG intends to provide a forum for

- prospective and new Trilinos users to get in touch with the Trilinos community and to have first-hand interaction with other active Trilinos users and developers,
- expert Trilinos users to exchange their experiences, discuss use cases, and obtain first-hand information about recent developments,
- active Trilinos developers to discuss current developments, get in personal contact with de- velopers from SNL, and share news about their recent developments with the Trilinos com-munity.

All levels of academic education are welcome. To account for different levels of software proficiency in general and for Trilinos experience in particular, the program consists of different elements tailored to a diverse audience.
