## About the meeting

The _European Trilinos User Group (EuroTUG)_ meeting series offers a platform for Europe-based users and developers
of the [Trilinos Project](https://trilinos.github.io) to

- learn about recent developments in Trilinos,
- report on their use cases and experiences with Trilinos,
- interact with the Trilinos leadership and core developers, and
- form a European network of Trilinos users and developers.

While the annual Trilinos User Group meeting hosted by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in Albuquerque, NM,
serves as the main community event for Trilinos users,
the EuroTUG facilitates easy access to the Trilinos community and reduced travel burdens for Europe-based researchers and application engineers
who are interested in the Trilinos project.

The EuroTUG 2022 meeting will be held in Munich, Germany, under the auspices of

- [dtec.bw](https://dtecbw.de), in particular its project [hpc.bw: competence platform for software efficiency and supercomputing](https://dtecbw.de/home/forschung/hsu/projekt-hpcbw/projekt-hpcbw).
